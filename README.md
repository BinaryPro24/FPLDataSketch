# FPLDataSketch
The following sketch shows how my FPL team performance has looked like each week. Below this, there'll be more information about the sketch and there is a legend within the sketch as well to help you understand what the sketch shows. 

Some Information about the Sketch:
Overall Rank: My rank (to the closest million) compared to over 15 million players.
Fallen Fruit, Bench Points: How many points have been left on my bench, the more dots = more missed points 
Trunk Width: Transfers that I have made; more transfers = wider width.
Trunk Height: Points earned (total points is mentioned on the tree), more points = longer trunk width.

This sketch only shows the first 12 weeks of the season, as you read this, the data for the remaining games is being collected.

Thanks for reading!
